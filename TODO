General
    - Need to replace GdkRegion usage, suggest create path to clip to
      (This can be used for Gtk2 as well)
    - Crashes X server when using inel driver? NVidia, and Xephyr, seem
      to be ok.

Scrollbars
    - look sunken when selected
    - loose mouse over when selected
    - if slider is small, groove is not drawn correctly
    - button orientation not correct - always horizontal

Entry fields
    - Background is drawn using highlight colour when active

ListView headers
    - Need way to detect first header. At the moment, just draw splitter
      on right hand side.

Combo Boxes
    - Unified style not working
    - Editable has double arrows
    - Editable's list is not drawn 'view' (i.e. KDE) like

      is clipped on left. :-(

Arrows
    - Odd clipping/drawing on down arrow
