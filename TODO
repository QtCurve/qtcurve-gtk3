General
    - Crashes X server when using inel driver? NVidia, and Xephyr, seem
      to be ok.
    - Opacity settings

ListView headers
    - Need way to detect first header. At the moment, just draw splitter
      on right hand side.
    - Drawing of lines - custom GC
    - Detection of sorted column

Combo Boxes
    - Focus on non-unified style combo button
        - glow: has glow and line (Gtk2 as well!!!)
        - filled: too small
        - full: too small (well is just filled wihtout fill!)
        - standard: too small
        - highlight: too small (similar to standard)
        - line: acceptable

Group Boxes
    - Alignment of group box titles. Currently if use Gtk2 code, then text
      is clipped on left. :-(
