General
    - Crashes X server when using intel driver? NVidia, and Xephyr, seem
      to be ok. Murrine also suffers from this.
    - Opacity settings [Disabled in qt_settings.c]

ListView headers
    - Need way to detect first header. At the moment, just draw splitter
      on right hand side.
    - Drawing of lines, no way to set line colour. Gtk3 *forces* black :-(
    - Detection of sorted column [Disabled in qt_settings.c]

Group Boxes
    - Alignment of group box titles. Currently if use Gtk2 code, then text
      is clipped on left. :-(

Popup-menus
    - Rounding not working [Disabled in qt_settings.c]

Windows
    - Dragging doesn't set cursor.
    - Gtk3 does not seem to support drag apart from men and toolbars.
    - Reisze handle too big?

Progress bars
    - Detect activity mode

Menubars
    - Detecting active
    - Items seem to only be rounded on top even on mouse-over
