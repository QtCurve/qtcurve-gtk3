General
    - Crashes X server when using inel driver? NVidia, and Xephyr, seem
      to be ok.
    - Opacity settings
    - Background gradient messes up scrollbars?

ListView headers
    - Need way to detect first header. At the moment, just draw splitter
      on right hand side.
    - Drawing of lines - custom GC
    - Detection of sorted column

Combo Boxes
    - Unified style not working
    - Editable has double arrows
    - Editable's list is not drawn 'view' (i.e. KDE) like

Group Boxes
    - Alignment of group box titles. Currently if use Gtk2 code, then text
      is clipped on left. :-(

Popup-menus
    - Rounding not working

WindowDrag
    - Gtk3 should now support this.

Progress bars
    - Animation

Menubars
    - Detecting active
    - Items seem to only be rounded on top even on mouse-over
