General
    - Crashes X server when using intel driver? NVidia, and Xephyr, seem
      to be ok. Murrine also suffers from this.
    - Opacity settings [Disabled in qt_settings.c]

ListView headers
    - Need way to detect first header. At the moment, just draw splitter
      on right hand side.
    - Detection of "row_ending_details" - is this required?

Popup-menus
    - Rounding not working [Disabled in qt_settings.c]

Progress bars
    - Detect activity mode

ComboBoxes
    - KDE-style non-editables not working 100% [Disabled in qt_settings.c]
