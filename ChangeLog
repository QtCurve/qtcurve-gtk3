1.8.0
-----
 1. Add option to not display keyboard shortcurt underline until 'Alt' is
    pressed.
 2. Add options to specify appearance of toolbar buttons.
 3. Allow to use popup menu shade factor when colouring as per menubar.
 4. Fix painting of alternate listview rows.
 5. Remove QTC_CAIRO_1_10_HACK cmake option. For cairo 1.10, an easier fix is to just
    ensure there is no colour stop at 1.0. Thanks to Hugo Pereira Da Costa for
    pointing this out.
 6. Use list style pop-up for non-editable combos when not using Gtk-style
    combos - matches KDE behaviour.
 7. Dont use Gtk code for dragging windows - use QtCurve's own code, as per Gtk2. This
    allows to drag in other areas as well as menu and toolbars.
 8. Implement hover and focus for *some* scrolled windows.
 9. Use gdk_pointer_is_grabbed() to determine if a menubar item has a menu open.
10. Add support for KDE4 StartDragDist and StartDragTime config items to control when
    window drag starts.
11. Use configure-event, and not resize-request, to detect window size changes.
12. Fix splitter background when highlight set to 0.
